# Order Unit Spaces

An **order unit space** (V, V⁺, 1) is a real ordered vector space with a distinguished
order unit.  Two honesty notes on this encoding: the domination field below is the
*order-unit* boundedness property (`a ≤ r • 1`), not the full Archimedean condition;
and the carried `NormedAddCommGroup`/`NormedSpace` structure is an independent normed
structure, not derived here as the order-unit norm.

## Main definitions

* `OrderUnitSpace` — typeclass for ordered real vector spaces with an order unit
  (order-unit boundedness)
* `OrderUnitSpace.IsEffect` — predicate for the effect space [0, 1]_V

/-! ## `lem:span`: the effects span, and linear maps are determined on them

The article proves the spanning property through the order-unit *norm* — if `‖v‖ ≤ ½`
then `0 ≤ ½𝟙 + v ≤ 𝟙`, so the effects contain a ball about `½𝟙`.  That route needs the
carried norm to *be* the order-unit norm, which this interface deliberately does not
assert (see the class docstring), and needs the Archimedean property proper rather than
the order-unit boundedness the `archimedean` field carries.

The two conclusions the article draws — that the effects span and that linear maps
agreeing on effects are equal — do not need either.  They follow from order-unit
boundedness alone, which is what is proved here: strictly more general than the
norm route, and available at exactly the interface's own strength.  The ball clause
itself is *not* formalized; it is the article's route, not its content. -/

/-- **`lem:span`, spanning clause.**  The effects span the whole space.  Proof from
order-unit boundedness only: bound `x` above by `r • 𝟙` and `-x` above by `s • 𝟙`, so
that `x + s • 𝟙` is nonnegative and below `(r+s) • 𝟙`; rescaling by
`c = r + s + 1 > 0` lands it in the effects, and `x = c • (that) - s • 𝟙` with `𝟙`
itself an effect. -/
