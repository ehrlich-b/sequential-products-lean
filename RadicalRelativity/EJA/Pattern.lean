# The Faraut–Korányi block pattern, forced by three constraints

**ARC-9 block 9.18, 2026-08-13.**

`EJA/Block.lean` characterises the rank-two block `J₁(p+q)`. This file does the frame-level
analogue, but as a **constraint on eigenvalue patterns** rather than as an assembled direct
sum — which is both what is provable here and what the FK block structure actually *is*.

Let `p` be an orthogonal idempotent family and `x ≠ 0` a joint eigenvector,
`pᵢ ∘ x = μᵢ • x`, lying in `J₁(∑ pᵢ)`. Three facts:

* `sum_eigen_eq_one` — **`∑ μᵢ = 1`**;
* `eigen_pattern_mem` — **each `μᵢ ∈ {0, 1/2, 1}`** (the trichotomy, applied at each `pᵢ`);
* `eigen_pattern_card_le_two` — **at most two `μᵢ` are nonzero**, since every nonzero one is
  at least `1/2` and they sum to `1`.

Together these force the Faraut–Korányi pattern: **either exactly one `μᵢ` is `1` — the
diagonal block `J_ii` — or exactly two are `1/2` — the coherence block `J_ij`.** The
arithmetic is immediate from the three: zero nonzero entries give sum `0 ≠ 1`; one gives a
single entry equal to `1`, so it is `1` and not `1/2`; two give `a + b = 1` with
`a, b ∈ {1/2, 1}`, whose only solution is `1/2 + 1/2`.

★ **That packaged statement is deliberately NOT a theorem here.** Formalising it means
extracting the elements of a `Finset` of cardinality `≤ 2` and case-splitting, which is
bookkeeping with no mathematical content, and stating it without proving it is exactly the
defect this arc spent four audit rounds removing. The three constraints are proved; the
one-line consequence is written out above so a reader can check it rather than trust it.

★ **What is still not built:** the assembled direct sum `J = ⊕_{i ≤ j} J_{ij}`. These
constraints say what the summands can be, not that every element decomposes into them.
