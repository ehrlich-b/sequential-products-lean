# Formal reality, and the absence of nilpotents

**ARC-9 block 9.10, 2026-08-12.**

A Euclidean Jordan algebra is a finite-dimensional real Jordan algebra that is **formally
real**: a sum of squares vanishes only if every summand does. This file adds that hypothesis
as a mixin and draws the consequence that the spectral theorem (E1) needs first —
**`nilpotent ⟹ zero`**.

The nilpotence result is the first place in this development where **Albert's theorem does
real work**: `x^{k+1} ∘ x^{k+1} = x^{2k+2}` is a *product* identity, so without
`jpow_mul_jpow` there is no way to turn "some power vanishes" into "a square vanishes",
which is the only thing formal reality can see.

## What is here

* `IsFormallyReal` — the mixin, stated over a `Finset` sum so that it is the usual
  many-summand condition rather than the two-summand special case.
* `eq_zero_of_mul_self_eq_zero` — the one-summand case: `x ∘ x = 0 ⟹ x = 0`.
* `eq_zero_of_jpow_eq_zero` — **no nilpotents**: if any power of `x` vanishes, `x = 0`.

## What is not

No trace form, no inner product, no finite-dimensionality, and **no spectral theorem**. The
spectral theorem additionally needs `ℝ[x]` to be finite-dimensional and reduced, and then the
classification of finite-dimensional reduced commutative `ℝ`-algebras. Formal reality is what
supplies "reduced"; the rest is not built.

★★ **CLOSED THE SAME DAY, and the paragraph that stood here is worth keeping in outline.** It
read: *"No non-vacuity witness is supplied for `IsFormallyReal` … every theorem in this file is
conditional on a hypothesis with no carrier in this tree."* True when written, false within the
hour: `EJA/Witness.lean` now carries `instIsFormallyReal : IsFormallyReal (HermitianMat d 𝕜)`,
so both theorems below are live on the paper's own carrier
(`hermitian_eq_zero_of_jpow_eq_zero`).

★ The proof needed nothing new — `inner_self_nonneg` and `InnerProductCore.definite` are
vendored and `symmMul_self` says the Jordan square *is* the matrix square. What was missing was
the application, which is the third time in this arc that a residue named a hypothesis and a
conclusion whose connecting lemma was already in the tree (after row 35 and the FK fields).
**When a file's own docstring declares an exposure, try to close it before writing the sentence
that documents it.**

★ This is where Albert's theorem earns its place. Formal reality can only see *squares*, and
turning "some power vanishes" into "a square vanishes" is exactly the product identity
`jpow_mul_jpow` supplies. In this file's indexing (`jpow x n = x^{n+1}`) the descent from
`jpow x (k+1) = 0` runs: `jpow x (k+k+1) = 0` by `jpow_eq_zero_of_le`, that element **is**
`jpow x k * jpow x k`, so formal reality gives `jpow x k = 0`, and the index has strictly
dropped. -/
