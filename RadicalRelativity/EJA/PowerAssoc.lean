# Albert's theorem: power associativity

**ARC-9 block 9.9, 2026-08-12.**

**`jpow_mul_jpow`: `x^{m+1} ∘ x^{n+1} = x^{m+n+2}` in any real commutative Jordan algebra.**
Unconditional; closure is Lean's three core axioms.

This is the gateway to **(E1)**, the Jordan spectral theorem: the spectral resolution of `x`
lives in the subalgebra `ℝ[x]`, and that argument cannot begin until `ℝ[x]` is associative.
Per `lean-formalization-landscape` it exists in no other proof assistant, and Mathlib has
nothing between `IsCommJordan` and this.

★★ **This file refutes `WallCertificates/eja-power-assoc.lean`, written three hours earlier
in the same arc.** See that file's REFUTED header, and `LEDGER.md` ARC-9 block 9.9, for what
the mispricing was and why it is the arc's most useful finding.

## The proof

Write `cm x i j w` for the commutator `[L_{x^{i+1}}, L_{x^{j+1}}]` applied to `w`. The whole
theorem is `cm x i j w = 0`, since `EJA/Power.lean`'s `jpow_mul_jpow_of_commuteAt` already
turns commutation into the product law.

The engine is `cm_cyclic`: for `i + j = N` (and given the product law at level `N`), the
fully linearised Jordan identity `four_lin2_apply` collapses to

  `cm x j (i+1) w + cm x 0 (N+1) w + cm x i (j+1) w = 0`.

Now fix `N` and `w` and look at the "antidiagonal" `d k := cm x k (N+1-k) w`. The identity
says exactly `d j + d 0 + d i = 0` whenever `i + j = N`, and antisymmetry says
`d k = − d (N+1−k)`. Together these force

  `d (k+1) = d k + d 0`,  hence  `d k = (k+1) · d 0`,

and the wrap-around `d (N+1) = − d 0` then gives `(N+3) · d 0 = 0`. In a real vector space
that means `d 0 = 0`, so the whole antidiagonal vanishes and the induction advances.

★ **`(N+3)` is where the characteristic hypothesis actually bites.** Not `2` — the factor-of-2
divisions in `EJA/Peirce.lean` are carried explicitly and cost nothing. Albert's theorem needs
*every* positive integer invertible, which is why the statement lives over `Module ℝ J` and
would fail in characteristic `p` with `p ≤ N+3`. This is the one place in the EJA layer where
the real scalars are load-bearing rather than convenient.

## Relation to Mathlib

The Mathlib-facing shape is `instance : PNatPowAssoc J` — the class
(`Mathlib/Algebra/Group/PNatPowAssoc.lean`, `ppow_add : x ^ (k + n) = x ^ k * x ^ n`) already
exists with two users. Supplying the `Pow J ℕ+` instance and transporting `jpow_mul_jpow`
across it is the upstream contribution. **Not done here** — that translation is unwritten, and
this file should not be read as providing it.
