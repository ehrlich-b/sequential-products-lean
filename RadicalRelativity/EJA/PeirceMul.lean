# The Peirce multiplication rules

**(E2), the second half — ARC-9 block 9.4, 2026-08-12.**

`EJA/Peirce.lean` decomposes `J = J₁(c) ⊕ J_{1/2}(c) ⊕ J₀(c)` for an idempotent `c`. This
file proves how the three components multiply — the Faraut–Korányi relations:

| | `J₁` | `J_{1/2}` | `J₀` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`J₁`** | `⊆ J₁` | `⊆ J_{1/2}` | `= 0` |
| **`J_{1/2}`** | `⊆ J_{1/2}` | `⊆ J₁ ⊕ J₀` | `⊆ J_{1/2}` |
| **`J₀`** | `= 0` | `⊆ J_{1/2}` | `⊆ J₀` |

As in `EJA/Peirce.lean`, the hypotheses are the Jordan identity and the invertibility of the
integers used (`2` for the commuting rules, `4` for the half-half rule): no spectral theorem,
no formal reality, no finite dimension, no unit.
★ Corrected 2026-08-12 from "the only hypothesis is the Jordan identity", which was the same
overclaim `EJA/Peirce.lean`'s docstring carried — fixed there first, and found here only by
grepping the layer for the phrase rather than trusting that one fix had covered it.

## The two ingredients

`EJA/Peirce.lean` needed only the *once*-linearised Jordan identity `two_lin1_raw`. Five of
the six rules follow from a single consequence of it — **`L_x` commutes with `L_c` whenever
`x` lies in `J₁(c)` or `J₀(c)`** (`mul_comm_of_eigen_one`, `mul_comm_of_eigen_zero`) — after
which each rule is one rewrite.

The sixth, `J_{1/2} ∘ J_{1/2} ⊆ J₁ ⊕ J₀`, is genuinely deeper and needs the *fully*
linearised identity `four_lin2_raw`, obtained here by polarising `two_lin1_raw` a second
time. Evaluated at the right point it collapses to `L_c² = L_c` on the product, which is
exactly "the `1/2`-component vanishes".

## Why `opCommute_eigen_one_zero` is the one to look at

`MasterTheorem/Coalescence.lean` proves `lem:coalescence` (manifest row 16) over
`CoalescenceSetup` from four fields, of which the load-bearing one is
`simDiag_opCommute` — *an element scalar on `range q` and an element of `J₂(q)`
operator-commute* — carried as a cited Faraut–Korányi hypothesis. Its single-idempotent
case is `opCommute_eigen_one_zero` below, and it is three lines from `four_lin2_raw`.

★ **That is a case, not the field.** The field quantifies over a rank-two `q = pᵢ + pⱼ`
drawn from a Jordan *frame*, and this file has no frame. No manifest row moves on this file,
and none is claimed to.

★★ **Status of that gap, updated 2026-08-13 (ARC-9 blocks 9.6/9.7/9.14/9.16).** This
paragraph used to end *"…needs these rules plus the commutation of the projections of
distinct frame idempotents. Not built."* Both named ingredients are now built:
`EJA/Frame.lean` has orthogonal idempotent families and puts the field in the interface's own
shape (`opCommute_scalarOn_frame`), and `EJA/Block.lean` has the projection commutation
(`peirceOne_comm_peirceOne` and siblings) as well as the exact characterisation of the
rank-two block. What is **still** not built is the assembled frame-level statement
`J = ⊕_{i ≤ j} J_{ij}` as a single theorem, and the bridge from this typeclass layer to
`ComparisonSetup`'s bilinear-map interface (block 9.15).

we use, but Mathlib's corresponding lemmas are phrased for the `AddMonoidHom` coercion and do not
match the `AddMonoid.End` one.  Lean 4.28's simp set bridged this on its own; 4.30's does not, so
the four `rfl`s are stated here and passed to `simpa` explicitly. -/

An element of `J₁(c)` and an element of `J₀(c)` **operator**-commute: `L_x L_y = L_y L_x`,
which is strictly more than the product `x ∘ y` vanishing. It falls straight out of the
cyclic identity, because two of its three brackets vanish.
